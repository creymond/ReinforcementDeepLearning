# Reinforcement deep learning

This project aims to create an automated agent which interacts with environments from OepnAI Gym framework. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

The only requierement to run this project is to have Python 3 installed on your local machine.

### Installing

Installing the virtual environment with Python3 

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the tests

We have created two agents : AgentCartpole and AgentAtari. They are quite similar but tend to be independent. Each of those classes owns a main. They can be runned separatly.
